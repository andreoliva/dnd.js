dnd.js v1.0
============
A drag'n'drop library for javascript.

Why?
------------
This library tries to create a simple drag'n'drop implementation that will have the same behavior on desktops and touch devices, taking into account things like scaling, drop point detection and action callbacks. Another goal is to create something totally independent from other libraries (jQuery, I'm looking at you).

Installation:
------------
Just add the dnd.js to your project and include it in your html.
```
<script src=path/to/dnd.js></script>
```

How to use it:
------------
_This section is under construction, come back later._

Tested on:
------------
- Google Chrome (and its device emulators)
- Mozilla Firefox
- Internet Explorer 10+
- **theoretically** it'll work on any CSS3 capable browser

To do list:
------------
- adapt it to receive multiple touches
- finish writing this read me
- another stuff I'll remember some day
